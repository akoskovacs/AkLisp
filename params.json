It is embeddable, user-friendly and relatively fast.\r\n\r\n## About Lisp/Scheme\r\n> [Lisp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language\\)) is a family of computer programming languages, with a long history and a distincitve parenthesized *Polish notation*.\r\n\r\nEvery expression is written in the form of nested lists. In Lisp-style languages, the elements of the list is surrounded by parantheses, where the first element is the function and the other elements are the arguments of the function. The list elements are separated by whitespaces. Consider the following example in C:\r\n```c\r\nint a = (10 + 2) * 2;\r\n```\r\nWhich is written in Lisp as:\r\n```lisp\r\n(set! a (* 2 (+ 10 2)))\r\n```\r\nBoth set the *a* variable to 24\r\n\r\nEvery list is automatically evaluated if they are not quoted. To quote a list, just write a \\' before the list, like:\r\n```lisp\r\n'(+ 1 2 3) ; Will be threated as data\r\n```\r\nEvery list is implemented as a singly linked list in the interpreter. You can devide lists to a head and tail. The head is the first element. And the tail is a list of the subsequent elements.\r\n```lisp\r\n(head '(:one 2 3 :four))            ; => :one, the first element\r\n(tail '(:one 2 3 :four))            ; => '(2 3 :four), the subsequent elements\r\n; Therefore the second element can be easy gathered with:\r\n(head (tail '(:one 2 3 :four)))     ; => 2, the second element\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Building from source\r\nThese instructions only applies to unix-style systems. **Windows builds are not supported at this time.**\r\n### Getting the code\r\n * with git: `git clone git://github.com/akoskovacs/AkLisp.git`\r\n * or download the gzipped [package](https://github.com/akoskovacs/AkLisp/archive/master.tar.gz) and unpack it.\r\n\r\n### Compilation\r\nBefore you can compile the program, you must satisfy the build dependencies. AkLisp have three main dependencies:\r\n * *dl*: The dynamic linking loader library (should be installed by default)\r\n * *readline*: GNU ReadLine library (Install with `sudo apt-get install libreadline5-dev libreadline5` on Debian/Ubuntu)\r\n * *GNU toolset*: GCC, and make (Install with `sudo apt-get install build-essential` on Debian/Ubuntu)\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to compile AkLisp from source.\r\n#### Without CMake\r\nThis way is preferred when you only want to use the aklisp binary (no library will be builded).\r\n```\r\n$ make\r\n```\r\n*This command will build the aklisp binary and the modules in the modules/ directory.*\r\n\r\n#### With CMake\r\nFor this, you must install the cmake package.\r\n```\r\n$ sudo apt-get install cmake     # on Debian/Ubuntu\r\n$ cmake .\r\n$ make\r\n```\r\n*This will also build the aklisp binary libaklisp_static.a (static software library) libaklisp_shared.so (shared library).*\r\n\r\n## Interesting things to try\r\n### Interactive shell\r\nWhen no arguments are given the executable will start an interactive shell. This is the most convenient way to try the interpreter. If the executable linked with the ReadLine library, you can also use tab-completition between the parentheses.\r\n```lisp\r\n$ ./aklisp\r\nInteractive AkLisp version 0.1-alpha\r\nCopyleft (C) 2012 Akos Kovacs\r\n\r\n[1]> (time)\r\n(TIME)\r\n => (22 3 55)\r\n[2]> \r\n```\r\n\r\n### Loadable modules\r\n```lisp\r\n$ ./aklisp\r\nInteractive AkLisp version 0.1-alpha\r\nCopyleft (C) 2012 Akos Kovacs\r\n\r\n[1]> (load \"modules/dir.alm\")\r\n(LOAD \"modules/dir.alm\")\r\n => T\r\n[2]> (glob \"*.txt\")\r\n(GLOB \"*.txt\")\r\n => '(\"CMakeCache.txt\" \"CMakeLists.txt\" \"install_manifest.txt\")\r\n[3]> \r\n```\r\n\r\n## Known issues\r\n  * No way to define functions [bug #2](https://github.com/akoskovacs/AkLisp/issues/2)\r\n  * Interpretatiton works just-in-time *\\(no, not JIT\\)* no bytecode emission or optimization is performed [bug #5](https://github.com/akoskovacs/AkLisp/issues/5)\r\n  * Bugs, bugs, bugs...\r\n\r\n## License\r\nAkLisp is licensed under the permissive MIT license.\r\n```\r\nCopyright (c) 2012 Ákos Kovács - AkLisp Lisp dialect\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\r\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\r\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\r\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\r\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\r\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\r\nthe following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\r\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, \r\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\r\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\r\nNONINFRINGEMENT.
